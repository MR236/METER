Graphical Summaries
======================

If you have obtained future state probabilites for an individual using :py:func:`.survivorship_vector`, you can obtain a nice stacked area plot of state probabilities using :py:func:`.survivorship_graph`. The aesthetic value of these plots is heavily dependent on your choice of colours, so you may want to play around with that a bit.
