    ex. ['Birth', 'First_Film', 'Death'] with first taken as study entry

    states: a list with the set of states in the desired model (eg. ["Person", "Performer", "Death"])

    you want to censor at (ex. First_Film)

    transition_names: a list of the names of the columns that contain the transition years
